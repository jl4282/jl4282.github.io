  <li><p>Final Project Rough Draft</p><p>Instructions: requires phone, uses imu to determine motion. Bob your head left and right to the beat of the ball to move it. Still lots of work to do on it...</p><p><a href="public/finalproj/imucode/roughdraft.html">Let's go</a></p>To do (ideally):<ul>
    <li>Implement game part -> need to move ball to keep it on the platforms</li>
    <li>Add more logic to ease transitions</li>
    <li>Fix speed issues -> one bounce per beat per rectangle</li>
    <li>Also plan on creating freeform music maker -> bobbing head to the beat creates different melodies depending on how your bob</li>
  </ul></li>

    <p>Final Project</p>
    <p><strong>About:</strong> The idea was to see whether you can influence by dancing and bobing your head to your (imaginary) beat. Unfortunately the IMU wasn't working as well as I anticipated. It's hard figuring out where the player is looking, whether it's the top left, bottom right, or so forth. It's an interesting proof of concept though, which could definitely use better music in further development.</p>
    <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Please use an Android phone, in a VR headset (Cardboard or somethign of the sort). Currently, the imu number at which point things are left or right of is 180. You may need to turn around in order to get to 180. This is the "Direction" number displayed on the screen. The two values after it are which way you are looking, upper left, upper right, bottom left, bottom right. It calculates the sum of where you look over over a 55 frames to determine where you're looking. Enjoy!</p>
