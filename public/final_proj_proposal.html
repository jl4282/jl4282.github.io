<h1>Final Project</h1>
<p>For the final project I would like to create an interactive experiecne either using Unity or Chalk Talk. Ideally I would like to utilize procedural generation, and create an interactive experience where each object gives makes a sound when walking near it, and whichever way you walk, a song will play. That is my ambitious goal, but my basic goal is really just to combine everything we've learned and create an interactive experience.</p>
