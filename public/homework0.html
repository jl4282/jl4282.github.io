	<p>One of the main reasons I’m taking Computer Graphics because I want to deepen my understanding of games. I’ve spent countless hours and dollars on games and I always see graphics jargon in articles, but never understood what it refers to. Understanding these concepts will increase my appreciation for games. Why is Civilization Beyond Earth able to run on Intel HD Graphics 4000, but Apotheon is slow? I want to understand the limitations within graphics, and the implications for game design.</p>

	<p>I also want to learn C# and Unity. I’ve fooled around with Unity a little in the past, but I want to deepen my understanding of it, and learn how to create VR experiences. Ultimately I’d love to be able to program VR experiences or games by the end of the class. In Unity I know how to setup a scene, although I want to learn how to add scripts to objects and interaction between objects. I love programming and I also love games, so I’d love to combine the two in Unity and learn programming for games.</p>

	<p>I’m also very curious about the future of computer graphics. We’ve discussed in class that it computer graphics is moving towards VR and AR, although I want to learn more about the trends within the industry. I’m curious about how Microsoft’s HoloLens can disrupt the industry, and how people design specifically for VR and AR. It’s an entirely new design philosophy that I want to learn.</p>

	<p>Lastly, I’m curious about the philanthropic impact of VR and AR. How can we use these technologies to better the world in a quantifiable way? I’d love to discuss the possibilities in class.</p>
